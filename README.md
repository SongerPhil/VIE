# Unsupervised Learning from Video with Deep Neural Embeddings

Please see codes in `build_data` to prepare different datasets, you need to have kinetics at least to run the training. 
After that, please see codes in `tf_model` to train the model and evaluate it.
Finally, check `show_results.ipynb` in `notebook` folder to see how the training progress can be checked and compared to our training trajectory.
